Prerequisites
------------
You will need :
* Access to the internet 
* A recent version of java (6 or above)
* Your favorite text editor (it's better if it can highlight scala syntax)

Launch the hands-on session
------------

In this directory, just run 
* ```./handson``` on linux/osx
* ```handson.bat``` on windows 

These scripts launch SBT (the Scala Build Tool), once in the SBT session, just type :

    go

This launches the hands-on itself. Now your duty is to fill the blanks in the files that are under `src/test/scala` (except `HandsOn.scala` which contains only utility code).

The tests will run each time you modify a file, showing errors if any, and advancing through the exercises as you solve them.

Have fun !
